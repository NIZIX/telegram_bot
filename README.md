This repository is VERY simple telegram bot, what uses GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) language model to answer user

You can run the bot yourself by inserting telegram and openai api keys in config_bot file, or use my bot directly in telegram https://t.me/NlZlX_BOT.

Now the bot doesn't know what you wrote before, but I'm working on it.
